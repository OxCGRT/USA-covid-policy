Gina Raimondo has announced an aggressive plan to test tens of thousands of residents for the novel coronovirus as well as free antibody tests to random residents. Right now, Rhode Island is testing 7% of the state or about 3,000 people a day for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Raimondo said. The governor would like to see the state testing 10,000 residents a day by July and 20,000 by the end of September.  The increased testing will help to identify those who need to be isolated and will help in the contact tracing efforts. https://web.archive.org/web/20200707220641/https://www.necn.com/news/coronavirus/ri-gov-raimondo-to-provide-coronavirus-update-4/2268610/",1,,,,,,,,10205,370,79.63,79.63,78.57,78.57,82.05,82.05,78.79,78.79,100,100

These twelve teams will offer mobile testing to residents in hard-hit communities and visit facilities like homeless services centers and nursing homes. The mobile testing sites offer drive-through and walk-up tests free of charge to any Illinois resident who wants to be tested. In addition to the site operating at Coles Elementary, the remaining testing sites are located in Rock Island, Cicero, Brighton Park, Springfield, and East St. Louis.    """"We now have 12 mobile teams that can be moved anywhere on any given day to mitigate and suppress emerging outbreaks, including places like meatpacking plants, nursing homes, migrant worker housing and other communities less able to access traditional testing clinics. That puts us on the cutting edge nationally in flexible testing to meet the demands of a more open economy - and I'm thrilled that Illinois is leading the way,"""" said Governor JB Pritzker. """"And to be clear, these mobile teams are in addition to our 11 free, state-run drive through and walk up testing sites across the state. Illinois has built one of the largest testing programs in the nation, and that's partly the reason we have made so much progress fighting COVID-19 statewide. Performing nearly 30,000 tests per day allows us to monitor the progress of our mitigation strategies, target our testing toward vulnerable populations, and reduce the spread of this virus.""""

In order to allow schools to plan accordingly, and to ensure that learning still occurs until the end of the school year, we are suggesting that schools plan and prepare to have their curriculum carried out through a distance learning model. This is in no way to suggest that school is over for the year, but rather we should put all efforts into strengthening our delivery of education through distance learning.""""

State public health directives now do not prohibit in-person outdoor faith-based services or protests as long as face coverings are worn and physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. All other gatherings are prohibited until further notice, except as otherwise specifically permitted in state public health directives (including in applicable industry guidance).

There is a lack of sufficient information that quantifies the split of the funds so that the $ values can be updated to E3 and H4 accordingly. The same applies for the Stafford Act.     A summary of these aid packages is listed below:    The emergency coronavirus aid package - The emergency declaration follows an $8.3 billion emergency coronavirus aid package signed by the president on March 6. At least $1.05 billion of the previous aid package will go to state, local and tribal efforts through grants and cooperative agreements with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or as reimbursements from the federal government. The initial federal aid package was focused largely on public health concerns.      When the National Emergency was declared this allowed the administration to use the Stafford Act, a federal law governing disaster-relief efforts.

North Carolinians can now access new online tools to determine if they should consider being tested for COVID-19 and find a nearby testing place. The tool will also help individuals monitor their symptoms if they have tested positive for or been exposed to COVID-19. North Carolina contact tracing is being conducted by experienced and trained local health department staff and other COVID-19 Community Team members. Last week, the Community Team met its initial goal to hire and train 250 additional contact tracers who collectively are reflective of the racial, ethnic and linguistic diversity of North Carolina.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200715132803/https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/ncdhhs-launches-testing-and-contact-tracing-resources-help-slow-spread-covid-19",,,,,,,32075,1006,54.63,54.63,66.19,66.19,50.64,50.64,55.3,55.3,25,25

MDHHS is contracting with Great Lakes Community Engagement, a firm that specializes in outreach campaigns to engage citizens, and Every Action VAN, a voter/individual contact platform used by non-profits, to provide software to help organize remote phone banking and track information and contacts.    More than 2,200 volunteers have completed MDHHS’ contact tracing training and are ready to begin aiding local health departments. This workforce will increase the speed and thoroughness of contact tracing statewide. These volunteers are in addition to more than 130 MDHHS staff who have been assisting local health departments with case investigation over the past couple weeks and have reached more than 12,000 COVID-positive individuals.    Dedicating additional resources to contact tracing is needed as testing criteria and testing locations are rapidly expanding. Last week, MDHHS announced the expansion of testing to all Michiganders experiencing symptoms. Starting April 21, testing eligibility criteria is being expanded again to include all essential workers still reporting to work in person with potential COVID-19 exposure, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. This will help identify asymptomatic cases who may still be spreading the virus as they report to work.  “This means that anyone with symptoms can get a test as well as any individual regularly interacting with others outside their household, as long as the testing location has the supplies,” Khaldun said. “MDHHSis also working with local health departments to expand testing in group living facilities with potential exposure.”    https://web.archive.org/web/20200501110825/https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163-526523--,00.html",0,,0,,,,33324,2637,75.93,75.93,76.19,76.19,65.38,65.38,72.73,72.73,25,25

COVID-19 housing debt” means a money debt resulting at least in part from a breach of a residential lease, residential executory contract, or residential mortgage due to failure to make a required payment during a state of emergency or state of disaster arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic.  A conditional dismissal, pursuant to Michigan Court Rule 2.602, of a claim based on COVID-19 housing debt may provide for the Eviction Diversion Program (EDP) or any similar relief fund established at the county or municipal level to satisfy up to 90% of the amount due to the plaintiff via a lump sum rental assistance payment, subject to availability of funds.  Rental assistance under this section is available only for COVID-19 housing debt.  Non-COVID-19 housing debt must be paid by the tenant either in a lump sum or as part of a conditional dismissal.  A conditional dismissal that includes EDP rental assistance must require the defendant’s share of the amount due to be paid in 12 equal monthly payments.  In order to receive a lump sum rental assistance payment, plaintiff must waive any late fees or penalties, and must forgive one-ninth of one dollar of the remaining amount due for every dollar received as a lump sum payment. For example: (i) if a plaintiff receives $900 from the Eviction Diversion Program on a $1,000 arrearage, they must forgive the remaining $100; (ii) if a plaintiff receives $450 from the Eviction Diversion Program on a $1,000 arrearage, they must forgive $50, and the defendant tenant is responsible for paying the remaining $500 in twelve equal monthly payments.  Eligibility for rental assistance payments under section 3 will be based on tenant income and household size.  Households up to 100% of area median income (AMI), calculated based on income during the period for which assistance is sought, will be eligible for rental assistance, with a target of half of funds reserved for households earning less than 50% of AMI.  Tenant responsibility will vary based on AMI and amount due.  The Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity (LEO) must issue program guidance to implement this section.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200710011057/https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/0,9309,7-387-90499_90705-533074--,00.html",0,,0,,2,1,,3,,1,,0,,0,,,,69329,6134,46.3,46.3,60.71,60.71,47.44,47.44,51.52,51.52,25,25

Executive Order 20-12 allows DHS to temporarily issue waivers or modifications to state requirements to ensure that their services can be delivered to Minnesotans safely and without undue delay, protecting vulnerable Minnesotans and those who care for them.

Asymptomatic People in Congregate Settings  Congregate living settings including long term care facilities, shelters, and prisons. Testing should  be done according to guidance issued by MDH.  Staff Working in High Risk Settings  Employees working in high risk areas, including those working in hospital/clinic settings where  there is direct contact with COVID-19 patients, those working in long-term care facilities, shelter  workers, and prison guards. It is likely that some people will need testing on a regular basis  because of repeated high-risk exposures in the workplace. If a point-prevalence survey is done in a  facility, staff should be included as part of the prioritization for the facility-wide testing. If not  testing everyone, prioritize:  1. Symptomatic staff  2. Asymptomatic staff ending their quarantine period  3. Asymptomatic staff who work in a facility that has COVID-19 cases  Cluster Investigations  Cluster investigations where groups of people are associated with a case of COVID-19, even if a  direct contact isn’t identified. This could include specific workplace-wide or facility-wide clusters  implicated to have outbreaks of COVID-19. The testing approach should be done in consultation  with MDH.  Asymptomatic People Requiring Medical Care  Examples include: Patients planning to undergo an aerosol-generating procedure (procedure  involving the airway or esophagus such as intubation, bronchoscopy, upper esophageal  endoscopy, dental procedures, etc.), or patients undergoing other procedures that may be delayed  based on testing results (patients undergoing procedures like chemotherapy, cardiac surgery, or  other procedures in which COVID-19 infection may worsen outcome) or patients admitted to the  hospital.

Today, between Minnesota Department of Health and local public health officials, plus a contractor with workers available to provide surge staffing, there are currently a potential 800 people making contact tracing phone calls in Minnesota.    How many contact tracers are needed to adequately manage a pandemic depends on whom you ask, and what the spread of COVID-19 looks like at any given time. A staffing calculator by researchers at George Washington University suggests a baseline of 15 tracers per 100,000 population, which suggests Minnesota would need about 882. But it also has a staffing output that takes into account current case loads and suggests Minnesota needs more than 3,000 contact tracers.    While MDH claims that it currently has enough contact tracers, a number of unconnnected cases keeps appearing, suggesting that the contact tracing is not done to the extent justifying a 2 - although it is likely close to that treshhold.  http://archive.vn/snkMp  https://www.minnpost.com/health/2020/07/minnesota-is-contacting-people-who-have-been-exposed-to-covid-19-cases-at-current-infection-rates-it-might-not-do-much-good/ (webarchive unavailable)",,,,,,,52281,1620,53.7,53.7,59.52,59.52,50,50,54.55,54.55,25,25

It's the first reported person under investigation for the virus in Montana, according to the state Department of Public Health and Human Services.     Jim Murphy, the state Communicable Disease Control bureau chief said that when people travel from China to the United States, those who are being allowed back in the country are screened by federal health workers for symptoms.

Access to the kits means DPHHS no longer has to send samples to the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia. For patients and family members, that means a much shorter wait time to see if they're infected.

Immediately after an individual has been tested, the Health Department will begin a case investigation and contact tracing. While waiting for results, the individual will be asked to stay home. If they test positive, they will be called by the Health Department and asked to look back at their potential contacts over the past 14 days to help determine from whom they may have contracted the disease. They will also be asked to review the past 48 hours, before the onset of symptoms, to determine who they may have infected.

In Helena, drive-through testing will be conducted at PureView Health Center on Saturday June 6, and Saturday June 13.    “The point is really to see if there is COVID in the community among asymptomatic people,” said Purview Health Center CEO Jill-Marie Steeley. “This kind of screening test is for people who do not have symptoms and do not have any known exposure to COVID.”    The hope is that this screening will give public health a better idea of the prevalence of COVID-19 in local communities and the state. The testing is through an initiative by Governor Steve Bullock, is completely free to the individual and paid for by the State of Montana.

Recommends working from home where possible. “Because protecting personal liberty is deeply important, this Order is not a shelter-in-place mandate and instead strongly urges Tennesseans to stay at home when at all possible for the protection of themselves and their community”. The order was later updated to a requirement and extended.   “'Closure of non essential businesses for public use. Businesses or organizations that do not perform Essential Services shall not be open for access or use by the public or its members.

United States,USA,Alabama,US_AL,,,STATE_ALL,20200706,0,,"Per the Alabama State Department of Education guidelines, public schools reopened to all grades on July 6 for summer learning activities.     While the decision on reopening was ultimately left to local governments, there is a lack of evidence that schools have reopened and, conversely, a lack of evidence that they have remained closed for the summer. As American schools are typically closed during the summer months anyway, there is no evidence that continuing closures are due to COVID-19. Additionally, there is some evidence that at least some high schools in Alabama are open for summer athletic training. As such, this indicator has been coded to reflect a lack of school closure policy (0).

The order was initially issued until July 31.     Individuals are required to wear a mask when they are within six feet of people from other households in public indoor spaces, on public transportation, and in gatherings of ten or more when outdoors. The order created exceptions for “practical necessity,” such as with young children and when eating or drinking; for exercise; for “effective communication” where “the ability to see the person’s mouth is essential for communication”; for voting or limited religious reasons; and for essential job functions of first responders and where wearing a face mask would violate industry safety protocols.     The order also calls for businesses to encourage employees and customers to wear face masks, but does not require that they do so.

The program will also allow us to track containment of the disease to inform plans to re-open regions of the State.”    The Community-Based COVID-19 Testing Program will feature fixed drive through testing locations in Claremont, Lancaster, Plymouth, Tamworth and Rochester. Testing will be made available to any resident whose provider requests it. Residents should contact their primary care provider to get started. The sites will be open 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, and staffed by the National Guard and Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) personnel.

See archived webpage from WSDH website: https://web.archive.org/web/20200715081859/https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/Coronavirus/Resources    The Washington State Department of Health posted the following information on their COVID-19 Case Investigations and Contact Tracing webpage:  “Public health professionals perform case investigations and contact tracing to help slow and prevent the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. Local health departments lead this work and the Washington State Department of Health and its partners support this work.”    Thus, King County, the largest county in Washington State*, was used to gauge the timeline of contact tracing policies for the OxCGRT Policy Tracker. On June 15th, King County noted on their application to move from Phase 2 to Phase 3 that the department was only contacting a percentage of contacts and cases.  See page 4, 12, & 13:  https://web.archive.org/web/20200724044800/https://www.kingcounty.gov/~/media/elected/executive/constantine/news/documents/2020/KC_Phase_2_Application_2020-06-15.ashx?la=en    Additionally, media sources have indicated that King County (and other counties in Washington State) appeared to be struggling to keep up with case and contact tracing needs.

King County stopped contact tracing March 5.”    https://web.archive.org/web/20200724051450/https://apnews.com/4dc930ca385d1a4935f4381ee02f37c4  “The state has trained more than 2,100 people for the task. Contact tracing is a fundamental and decades-old public health tool, but Public Health — Seattle & King County had to stop investigating each case of the virus in early March, as the number of cases became overwhelming.”    https://web.archive.org/web/20200724045859/https://www.emsworld.com/news/1224505/covid-19-contact-tracing-wash-state-proving-challenging-public-health  “State workers took over the county's initial case investigations, and King County only followed up when a patient lived in or worked at a high-risk facility, such as a nursing home or homeless shelter. The shift allowed King County to """"focus on broad prevention strategies to reduce transmission"""" and managing the health care system as the virus spread, another spokesperson wrote in an e-mail.”    Because the first case of COVD-19 was confirmed on January 20th, 2020 (see archived link below), contact tracing for Washington State was presumed to have started on this day, as a part of the general public health system already in place.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200724050936/https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191    ---------  *King County is currently estimated to have the largest population in Washington State.

By default, public gatherings were banned by nature of not being able to gather. This was confirmed by the city of Seattle not issuing permits for major events until further notice.

This virus is unpredictable and has upended our regular ways of doing everything. Therefore, if COVID cases spike or spread, we may need to reassess this plan.

Wolf said. “It’s a testament to the many residents and businesses that have sacrificed over the past three months to stay home and adhere to the guidance the state has provided to protect lives and livelihoods. As we begin to reopen, I urge everyone to stay alert and continue to follow social distancing to maintain the momentum of mitigation we have in place.”    The only county not slated to move to green on June 26 is Lebanon County.
